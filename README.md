# Hamm's Passer 

## Who am I? 

I'm Sam Brown, a former bartender and web developer in training.  I grew up in 
Brookfield, right next to the Galloping Ghost Arcade.  This project is largely inspired
by my background as a bartender, and the games I would play at Galloping Ghost.

## What is Hamm's Passer? 
	
Hamm's Tosser is a game based on the classsic Bally Arcade cabinet, "Tapper", a game where
you play a bartender that slides beers down a bar to customers. As opposed to using draft beers
like the original game I chose cans of Hamm's as the beer of choice.  Hamm's was the staff beer
at the restarurant I worked for several years.  Speaking from expericence, 
Hamm's always tastes better after being slid down a bar.   

## What's needed to run? 

The game runs using the HTML canvas element and animation frames
The game can run in any web browser as long as it's big enough to hold the canvas element = 800px by 800px
It can be run on other systems as well as long as the screen size can be changed.

## Features to add Later 

Draft beer - space bar keyup to pass beer after certain time of keydown

Different types of patrons - images, need multiple beers to be served, throw empties back to bartender
* Partially implemented

Retrieving Empties - patrons throw empty beers back to bartender that need to be retrieved
